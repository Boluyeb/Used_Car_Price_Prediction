# Used_Car_Price_Prediction

The used car price prediction project is a machine learning-based project that involves predicting the price of used cars using various regression algorithms. The project utilizes a range of regression algorithms, including linear regression, XGBoost regressor, decision tree regressor, support vector regressor, random forest, and artificial neural networks, to predict the price of used cars.
The project begins by collecting a dataset of used cars that includes a range of features, such as the make and model of the car, its age, mileage, and various other attributes. This dataset is then preprocessed and cleaned to remove any missing values or inconsistencies.
The machine learning models are then trained on this preprocessed dataset to predict the prices of used cars. The project uses a range of regression algorithms to train these models, including linear regression, XGBoost regressor, decision tree regressor, support vector regressor, random forest, and artificial neural networks.
After training these models, the project evaluates their performance using various performance metrics, including mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared. The results show that the random forest regressor performed the best, achieving the lowest mean absolute error and mean squared error among all the algorithms used in the project.
Overall, the used car price prediction project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in predicting the prices of used cars. The project's results highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate regression algorithm to achieve the most accurate price predictions.
The complete notebook with the source code (artefact) has been added to github.
